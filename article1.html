          <p>    July 17th was certainly a memorable night for the members of CVL and the attendees of Smooth Criminal, the « Peaky Blinders » themed ball.  Minutes before 8pm, teens started flowing in gradually. They were welcomed at the front door of « Le Forum » and climbed a staircase leading to a reception table where tickets were checked or sold..</p>
          <p>   Later, they went through a security check before entering a spacious, beautifully lit ballroom decorated with balloons and small ornaments referencing the theme, such as plastic guns, hats and candles. There were few tables which left room for a perfect dance floor and kept most attendees on their feet all night long.</p>
          <p>   At 8:20pm, Hypnotize Band were first to take on the stage and mesmerise the crowd with a mixture of familiar rock and jazz songs that made everyone sway and cheerfully sing along. They surely knew how to create a festive atmosphere and keep the crowd well entertained. </p>
          <p>   Simultaneously, water, fizzy drinks and a buffet consisting solely of cookies were served and attendees were allowed to smoke inside the room.  At 9:30pm, the band got off stage and a few CVL members announced a surprise: Peaky Blinders T-shirts for sale and one free T-shirt to win. 9:40pm was when DJ 3rd Rave started to play his tunes. Almost everyone there jumped, flew their hands in the air and sang their hearts out for remixes of pop and rap songs. Then he proceeded to slip in a pleasant surprise for the crowd: traditional Tunisian rhythmic music. He quickly switched back to Spanish pop music and exciting beats that made the whole room throb.  </p>
          <p>  At 22:50pm, the famous DJ Danjer captivated jubilant teens as they danced and thoroughly enjoyed the midsummer night to a variety of rhythmic music. Smiling faces and jumping bodies were evidence of the DJ’s success at satisfying the crowd.  Smooth Criminal was, despite the relatively small number of attendees, a successful event and a delightful ball.</p></div>
